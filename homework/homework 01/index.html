	Designer Intent

	<p>
		Brittany believes that design emulates nature in its transparency. Her interests lie in understanding the complex relationships between product design in context of human perception.  She shares her concern for social and cultural impact by creating more purposeful, ethical and simple design solutions.  When a design has both accessibly and can answer to a user by assimilating to their habitual patterns, then a singular design can have great impact on a society.   She will continuously explore the dialogue between context, product, and human-centric relationships as a constant principal throughout her career, working towards pushing the creative boundaries challenging technology interfaces, environments, and manufactured products. This portfolio of work accumulated over a course of a career demonstrates the designer’s convictions through design problem solving, they are represented through hand sketching, prototyping and material experimentation adapting to each project challenge, resulting in an always creative, adaptive solution.
